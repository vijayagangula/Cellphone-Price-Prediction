# Cellphone-Price-Prediction
# Problem Statement

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
Task 2:-On the basis of the mobile Specification like Battery power, 3G enabled ,
wifi ,Bluetooth, Ram etc predict the Price range of the mobile.
Task 3:- Prepare the analysis report stating how model will help expanding the
business by stating several factors including feature importance.

## Dataset Link:
Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give a tough fight to big companies like
Apple, Samsung etc.
He does not know how to estimate the price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive
mobile phone market, you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data
of mobile phones of various companies.
Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory
etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve
this problem.
In this problem you do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the
price is.
